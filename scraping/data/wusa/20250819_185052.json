      "description": "The UW A Cappella Club is the umbrella club of all a cappella groups at the University of Waterloo! UWACC was founded in 2008 originally with one ensemble and has since expanded to include many different groups including the AcaBellas, the Unaccompanied Minors, ACE, the Musical InterDudes, the Water Boys, and In Full Colour. The Water Boys is a lower-voice auditioned group. The Unaccompanied Minors is a mixed-voice auditioned group. The AcaBellas is an upper-voice auditioned group. A Cappella Ensemble (ACE) is a mixed non-auditioned group. The Musical InterDudes is a small mixed-voice auditioned group focused on musical comedy. In Full Colour is a mixed-voice auditioned competitive small group focused on storytelling. Typically, auditions are held at the start of term. During the term, social events are held as well as workshops run by club members and professional musicians. The term ends off with the End of Term (EOT) concert held at one of the theatres on campus. Groups typically practice 1-2 times a week and learn around a 10-15 minute choreographed set for the EOT concerts. Outside of the EOT concerts, there are numerous performance opportunities on campus and within the KW area where the groups get to interact with the community at large. For further details on JOINING or PERFORMANCE REQUESTS, please email the groups directly. We look forward to singing with you!",

UW Campus Compost was established in 2014 to bring compost bins to campus back when the University did not have an organic waste collection system. Before its establishment, much of the groundwork started in 2012 under the \"University of Waterloo Compost Coalition\", led by a team of Environment students. Since then, the University has started its own organic waste program which makes organics disposal even more convenient on campus. While we still conduct our compost operations, we have expanded our mission to include advocacy around sustainability through campaigns and events.",

Whether you're a master jazz pianist, absolute beginner, or if you just want to learn how to play Wonderwall around a campfire, JamNetwork is the place to play. Come meet fellow music people and learn improv and theory skills along the way. (Don't worry - you don't need to know how to play Bohemian Rhapsody.) You can even just come watch and experience music. Everyone is welcome! With weekly drop-in meetings and field trips/community outings, we're all about expanding the music scene in Waterloo. So come one, come all, and let's make some magic together.",

The late pope’s unprecedented special relationship to young people in virtually every country of the world has inspired devotion in millions who, in turn, continue to instruct the next generation in his teachings. He is recognized as an agent of convicted and compassionate political transformation, and his teaching is a beacon of hope for forming loving, life-giving societies that celebrate what is truly good in all the world’s cultures. His three visits to Canada have left long-lasting impressions upon hundreds of thousands of Canadian young people, and the events and speeches from those visits continue to inspire. We are of the opinion that the body of literature and teaching that emanate from this great saint warrant special intention, and that his admirers merely need a structure in which to join others of like mind.",

As well, UW SSA attempts to participate in a wide range of multi-cultural activities both on campus, and within the Sikh community (such as trips to the Gurdwara, Vaisakhi, etc). In addition, our club organizes a number of intramural co-ed sports teams (Basketball and Volleyball, usually) and social functions (pool tournaments, bowling, etc.) and outings (dinners, horseback riding, skiing trips) that form the bulk of our time commitments. We hope to create a 'family' atmosphere by developing a hierarchy-less club that is devoted to providing an avenue for interaction amongst Sikh students at our University. UW SSA also provides educational help (study groups, old texts, exams, etc.) and holds one of the most successful on-campus events, 'Dastaar day', previously known as 'Turban Day' once a semester. This is an awareness day to teach the University community about the significance of the turban in Sikhism. We desire to produce conditions conducive to the further study, research and practice of Sikhism by our fellow Sikh students and all others interested in any aspect of the Sikh religion.",

It is estimated that Canadian women spend up to $6,000 in their lifetime on menstrual hygiene products. At UW Empower Cycle, we believe that menstrual products should not be a luxury but a necessity.

We host walk-in hours, clothing repairs, thrift flip workshops, and beginner-friendly sewing lessons. We prioritize creating a warm, welcoming space for you to learn and meet creative people who care about sustainability and making their wardrobe last. Whether you’re mending a button or creating something from scratch, we want to support your journey, help you grow your skills, and make sewing feel safe and accessible. We also understand sewing can be expensive, and not having the right equipment can make projects turn out poorly. That’s why we created this space, so you can use quality equipment without the pressure or financial burden, and feel encouraged and supported by fellow members and execs who genuinely care. Sustainable fashion shouldn’t cost a fortune, and you should never have to choose between dressing in a way that feels like you and making ethical choices. At Sew-Ciety, we believe in stitching those two values together, and creating something beautiful along the way :)",

Whether you are interested in fundamentals, popping, hip-hop, locking or breaking, come jam with us and enhance your skills and diversity. We focus a lot on freestyle dance and play a variety of beats during our sessions, allowing anyone to express themselves freely, while still be able to ask questions or gain greater insight on a certain groove or dance move. Our sessions will mainly focus on popping which is the technique of quickly contracting and relaxing muscles to create an intricate body movement. Popping also involves influences of hip hop, which will be practiced with grooves and rhythm. You do not need a background in dance to come, we are happy to session with you and teach you the skills that we have learned. Our club will differ from other HIP HOP clubs on campus through mainly focusing on freestyle dance sessions and not as heavily choreography based. If you want to expand your dance knowledge and be more free, come dance with us.",
