The interest earned on the fund is spent each year on undergraduate laboratory equipment, student projects, computer upgrades and academic tools/teaching facilities. The principle portion of the fund is never spent which allows the interest each year to grow, hence “The Gift That Keeps On Giving”. The donations that build the fund come from three sources: student donations, Employer Matching Contribution (EMC), and engineering Alumni (including graduates’ Plummer’s Pledge).",
